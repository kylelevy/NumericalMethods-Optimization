# Numerical Methods & Optimization

This repo contains a few demonstrations and comparisons of numerical methods for solving linear system of equations, ordinary differential equations, and optimizing single and multivariate functions. Each is applied to a case sudy scenario and the algorithms are compared for speed and computational efficiency.
